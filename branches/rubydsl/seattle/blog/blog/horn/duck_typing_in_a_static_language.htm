In the previous <a target="_blank" href="http://thesoftwaresimpleton.blogspot.com/2009/04/boo-compiler-extension-in-horn-dsl.html">post</a> I explained how the horn software system inserts an anonyomous base class into the pipeline in order to effectively become the base class which all Dsl scripts will inherit from.

I now want to explain how the following syntax was achieved
<div style="font-family: Courier New; color: black; background: white;">
<pre style="margin: 0px;">dependencies:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;package.homepage = "http://code.google.com/p/scotaltdotnet/"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;package.forum    = "http://groups.google.co.uk/group/horn-development?hl=en"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;package.contrib  = false
</div>
You might be wondering what in the world is unusual about this code and you would be correct to query the worth of explaining such trivial code.  

It seems even more trivial when you examine the horn source code and discover that there is a Package object which is defined below:
<div style="font-family: Courier New; color: black; background: white;">
<pre style="margin: 0px;">class Package(IQuackFu): 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[property(PackageInfo)]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public packageInfo as Dictionary[of string, object]
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def QuackGet(name as string, parameters as (object)) as object:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def QuackInvoke(name as string, args as (object)) as object:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def QuackSet(name as string, parameters as (object), value) as object:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packageInfo.Add(name, value)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def constructor():
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packageInfo = Dictionary[of string, object]()
</div>
The first thing of note is that there is not a homepage method or a forum method or indeed a contrib method but yet the horn dsl script compiles and is able to add the values to the horn domain model.

You might also note above that the Package object implements the IQuackFu interface which is quite possibly the best named interface the .NET framework.

The IQuackFu is boo's answer to method missing method not understood in dynamic languages.
